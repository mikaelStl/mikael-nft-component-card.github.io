## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS properties
- Flexbox

### Development

First I separated each important element into **div** tags, to facilitate the organization and stylization of the card, so I could separate each one in a way that they could not affect other elements, such as tags for titles, paragraphs or images. So I grouped each element, started editing the CSS file, for starters, I stored each needed color in a variable, using the **:root** pseudo-class, I also reset the margin and page padding to zero. With everything defined, I started to style the card, to make it easier to visualize in the browser, I styled the border of each group, then I started to define the margin, size and position of each element on the card. With the elements in their defined positions and sizes, I defined their colors, for the background and for the texts. Finally, I started defining the interaction with the elements, defining a **:hover** property for each element.
